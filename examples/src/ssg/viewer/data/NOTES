This directory contains sample VRML scenes made at the IICM.
Distribute them freely as long as you mention their origin.
They are also available at http://hgiicm.tu-graz.ac.at/C3d.

Most of the scenes were created with Wavefont's Advanced Visualizer
and converted with scripts into SDF, the (old) native format of the
Harmony 3D scene viewer. VRweb was used to convert these files into
VRML.
