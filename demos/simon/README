WELCOME TO S.I.M.O.N
====================

Which stands for:

     Simple
     Interface for
     Making
     Oliver's programs
     Nice.

This is a simple set of functions that hide much of the nastiness
of 3D programming to make it possible for someone with only the
very minimum of programming experience to write simple 3D applications.



INSTALLATION
============

Right now, you build SIMON by running 'make' and install it by
running 'make install' as root.  You must already have PLIB installed.

Simon installs into /usr/local/simon/libsimon.a /usr/local/simon/simon.h
and places an executable into /usr/local/bin/simon



RUNNING SIMON
=============

There are two ways to write SIMON programs:

  1) Write your code in C++ and link it to libsimon
     (the LIBRARY version of SIMON).

  2) Write your code in PSL (The PLIB Scripting Language)
     and use the 'simon' program to run it.

Documentation for both methods are in the 'doc' directory.



DEMO'S
======

AstroPong is my son's first ever game (his first ever program actually).
It was originally written in C++ using libsimon - but has subsequently
been converted into PSL for use as a demonstration program.

Once you've done a 'make install', you can change directory down into
the 'simon' directory and run:

       simon astropong.psl

...move your paddle using the joystick - don't let the herring
escape from the ice cube!
