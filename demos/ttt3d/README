INSTALLATION:

Installation instructions are pretty basic,
and are covered in the documentation directory 'doc'.

   OpenGL (or Mesa)
   GLUT (the GL Utility Toolkit)
   PLIB (which can be obtained from one of:
     http://plib.sourceforge.net

Once that is done, it should be a simple matter of changing
to the directory where all this stuff is unpacked and type:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

However, you might want to check the full documentation -
especially if you need to install Mesa/GLIDE/GLUT before
you can start.

All documents are in HTML - so view them with your web browser.
