<H1>Steve's 3D TicTacToe Player.</H1>
By <A HREF="mailto:sjbaker1@airmail.net">

<H2>Introduction.</H2>
TicTacToe - the worlds most boring game. Well, when played
in three dimensions with a 4x4 board, this simple game takes
on an entirely new level of intellectual challenge.
<H2>Installation:</H2>
<pre>

    ./configure
    make 
    make install

</pre>
If you are running Windoze or something that can't
run configure scripts and makefiles, don't sweat it.
There is just one C++ source file - no special options or libraries.
<p>
No, I won't provide a binary version, project
files and such.
<H2>License:</H2>
This program is offered under the terms of the GNU
Public License (GPL).
<H2>Instructions:</H2>
Run this from any shell:
<pre>

    ttt3d

</pre>
The computer takes 'O's and lets you go first. The first
person to make a row of 4 wins.
<pre>

Where would you like to play your X ? 
[1..64]: 

</pre>
(In the example above, the computer just played in square 43 the
asterisks help you see where he just played).
<p>
Imagine the four grids stacked on top of each other. (Either
from left to right or right to left - it doesn't matter).
You can form your row of four X's either within one layer -
or across layers.  Anything that would be a straight line in
3D.  So in this example:
<pre>

   |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |      
 X |   |   |         |   |   |         |   | O |      *O*|   |   | X    
___|_2_|_3_|_4_   17_|18_|19_|20_   33_|34_|___|36_   ___|50_|51_|___   
   |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |      
   | X |   |         |   |   |         |*O*|   |       X | O |   |      
_5_|___|_7_|_8_   21_|22_|23_|24_   37_|___|39_|40_   ___|___|55_|56_   
   |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |      
   |   |   |         |   |*O*|         |   |   |         | O | X | X    
_9_|10_|11_|12_   25_|26_|___|28_   41_|42_|43_|44_   57_|___|___|___   
   |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |      
 X |   |   |*O*      |   |   | X       |   |   |       O | X |   | O    
   |14 |15 |      29 |30 |31 |      45 |46 |47 |48       |   |63 |      

</pre>
...the computer just won with a diagonal line (when someone wins,
the winning line is highlighted with asterisks).
<p>
You'll find the computer is an extremely hard opponent to beat,
but it CAN BE DONE!
