PLIB Demonstration Programs and other Utilities.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The programs released under this directory are
fully complete programs written either as demonstrations
of PLIB or as useful utility programs.  Each one
has it's own licensing rules (although all are OpenSourced
in some way) and each has it's own build mechanism and
documentation.

You can build all of the demo's (on UNIX-like OS's)
by running the 'build_all_demos' script.

Enjoy!
