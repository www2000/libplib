<H1>The PLIB general Utility Library.</H1>
By Sebastian Ude
<H2>Introduction</H2>
The 'UL' utility library is primarily targeted towards hiding common
operating system functions behind a thin layer that makes them portable.
Additionally, it provides some helper classes or routines that were
usually written to support certain parts of the
<a href="../index.html">PLIB</a> library, but at some point we felt that
they could be useful for user applications as well.
<p>
UL is a part of <a href="../index.html">PLIB</a>.

<h2><a name="miscFunc">Misc. routines</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ulSleep">ulSleep</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  void ulSleep ( int seconds ) ;
</i></pre>
Now comes a typical example of what the UL library does. If you need to
'sleep' for, say, 3 seconds, then under Linux/UNIX, you'd need to call:
<pre><i>
  sleep ( 3 ) ;
</i></pre>
But under MS-Windows, you have to say:
<pre><i>
  Sleep ( 3000 ) ;
</i></pre>
In order to avoid writing non-portable code, you can instead call:
<pre><i>
  ulSleep ( 3 ) ;
</i></pre>
...under either operating system.

<p>
<h3><a name="ulMilliSecondSleep">ulMilliSecondSleep</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  void ulMilliSecondSleep ( int milliseconds ) ;
</i></pre>
Same as <a href="#ulSleep">ulSleep</a>, except that it sleeps (as you
may have guessed) a certain number of milliseconds instead of seconds.

<h2><a name="fileHandling">File handling</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ulFindFile">ulFindFile</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  void ulFindFile ( char *filenameOutput, const char *path, const char * tfnameInput, const char *sAPOM ) ;
</i></pre>
Basically, this utility function adds tfnameInput to the path and puts this
into the buffer filenameOutput.
<p>
It handles special chars in path:
<ul>
<li>";;" is replaced by ";"
<li>"$$" is replaced by "$"
<li>"$(APOM)" is replaced by sAPOM
</ul>
If there are ";" in path, the path-variable is interpreted as several paths
"segments", delimited by ";". The first file found by this function is
returned. It looks from left to right. A segment may end in $(...). ulFindFile
will then look in in this path and recursively in all the sub-paths.
<p>
Some examples:
<p>
To load *.MDl-models, it is very nice to set the texture path to
"$(APOM);$(APOM)/texture;$(APOM)/../texture". This consists of three segments
and tells ulFindFile to look in the path of the model, in a subpath texture
and in a path texture "besides" the path of the model. Some *.mdl-models are
shipped in a directory which contains a "texture"-directory, a
"Model"-directory and others. In this case you find the texture in
"$(APOM)/../texture".
<p>
Another example: You have all your textures in a directory-structure under
/roomplan:
<pre>
textures --+-- Wallpapers
           |
		   +-- Wood --+-- Oak
           |          |
		   |          +-- pine
           ...
</pre>
Then you should simply use the following texture path:
"/roomplan/$(...)"

<p>
<h3><a name="ulFileExists">ulFileExists</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  bool ulFileExists ( const char *fileName ) ;
</i></pre>
Returns "true" if a file with the name 'fileName' exists, or "false" if
it does not.

<p>
<h3><a name="ulIsAbsolutePathName">ulIsAbsolutePathName</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  int ulIsAbsolutePathName ( const char *pathname ) ;
</i></pre>
Returns '1' if 'pathname' is an absolute pathname or '0' if it is an
relative one.

<p>
<h3><a name="ulGetCWD">ulGetCWD</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  char * ulGetCWD ( char *result, int maxlength ) ;
</i></pre>
Stores the current working directory in 'result', which has enough space
for 'maxlength' characters, including the trailing '\0'. On success,
'result' is returned.

<p>
<h3><a name="ulMakePath">ulMakePath</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  char * ulMakePath ( char *path, const char *dir, const char *fname ) ;
</i></pre>
Concatenates the strings 'dir' and 'fname', puts the system's slash character
inbetween and stores stores the result in 'path'. Be sure that the buffer
'path' is large enough to store 'strlen ( dir ) + strlen ( fname ) + 2'
(slash and trailing '\0') characters.

<h2><a name="dirHandling">Directory handling</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ulDir">struct ulDir</a></h3>
This structure provides a portable way to read directories. To allocate and
initialize a new ulDir structure, call:
<pre><i>
  ulDir * ulOpenDir ( const char* dirname ) ;
</i></pre>
This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated ulDir structure on
success or a NULL pointer if the specified directory could not be read.
<p>
After you have constructed an ulDir structure, the directory content can
be read with subsequent calls to:
<pre><i>
  struct ulDirEnt
  {
    char d_name [ UL_NAME_MAX+1 ] ;
    bool d_isdir ;
  } ;
  ulDirEnt * ulReadDir ( ulDir *dir ) ;
</i></pre>
This function returns a pointer to a ulDirEnt structure which resides in
the corresponding ulDir structure and which has the above form. The "d_isdir"
flag indicates if a directory entry is another directory. If the end of the
directory has been reached, the function returns NULL.
<p>
To free an ulDir object and to close the associated directory stream,
please call:
<pre><i>
  void ulCloseDir ( ulDir *dir ) ;
</i></pre>

<h2><a name="dataStorage">Data storage</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ulList">class ulList</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  ulList::ulList ( int init_max = 1 ) ;
</i></pre>
This class stores a list of generic (void*) pointers using an
automatically-growing array. Since the process of resizing the internal
array is rather expensive, it is important that one picks a reasonable default
array size (<i>init_max</i>) when constructing an ulList object if performance
matters. Remember that a too large size means that some memory is wasted (but
memory is cheap nowadays), while a too small one means that expensive array
resize operations will be necessary later.
<p>
If you have absolutely no clue about how many entities will be stored,
you should probably look at the <a href="#ulLinkedList">linked list class</a>
below, which has it's own disadvantages, though.
<p>
Once you have constructed an ulList (hopefully with a good initial size),
you can insert an element using one of the following methods:
<pre><i>
  void ulList::addEntity ( void *entity ) ;
  void ulList::addBefore ( int n, void *entity ) ;
</i></pre>
While the first one simply adds the new entity to the tail of the list,
the second one lets you specify an exact position (0 is the first element).
Note that due to it's array implementation, inserting an entity at the head
or the middle of the ulList requires that the following entities are all
shifted one array slot to the right, which can be a rather expensive
operation.
<p>
These functions automatically check whether there is room for one more element
and double the internal array's size if necessary. However, as said
previously, resizing the array is a rather expensive process, so it is not
recommended that you rely too much on this behavior. Instead, pick a good
initial array size.
<p>
Note that ulList allows you to have multiple entities with the same data
value in the list. Please also note that ulList does not make it's own copy
of the data pointed to by 'entity'. It is up to you to take care of that the
memory region that 'entity' points to holds something useful as long as the
ulList exists. Be especially careful with addresses of variables that have a
limited lifetime.
<p>
To retrieve an entity, call:
<pre><i>
  void * ulList::getEntity ( unsigned int n ) ;
</i></pre>
Where 'n' is the position of the entity in the list. If 'n' is not a valid
index, NULL is returned. Once you have called this function, you can use
subsequent calls to
<pre><i>
  void * ulList::getNextEntity ( void ) ;
</i></pre>
in order to retrieve the following entities in the list. If there are no more
entities, this function will return NULL.
<p>
To remove an entity, call one of:
<pre><i>
  void ulList::removeEntity ( unsigned int n ) ;
  void ulList::removeEntity ( void *entity ) ;
</i></pre>
Where the second function removes the <b>first</b> entity with the specified
data value in case there are multiple ones.
<p>
To replace the value of an entity, call one of:
<pre><i>
  void ulList::replaceEntity ( unsigned int n, void *new_entity ) ;
  void ulList::replaceEntity ( void *old_entity, void *new_entity ) ;
</i></pre>
Where the second function will replace the value of the <b>first</b> entity
with the specified old data value in case there are multiple ones.
<p>
And finally, you can retrieve the number of entities stored in the list
(that's <b>not</b> necessarily the internal array's size), remove all
entities or retrieve the position of an entity by specifying it's data
value:
<pre><i>
  void ulList::getNumEntities ( void ) const ;
  void ulList::removeAllEntities () ;
  int  ulList::searchForEntity ( void *entity ) const ;
</i></pre>
Where the latter returns a negative value if no entity with the specified
value was found in the list, and otherwise the position of the <b>first</b>
entity with the specified data value.

<p>
<h3><a name="ulLinkedList">class ulLinkedList</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  ulLinkedList::ulLinkedList () ;
</i></pre>
The ulLinkedList class stores generic (void*) pointers using a linked list
of nodes where each node maintains a pointer to the next node.
<p>
This technique has some advantages compared to an array implementation of a
list like <a href="#ulList">ulList</a>.
<ul>
<li>
No wasted memory. When storing data using arrays (as
<a href="#ulList">ulList</a> does), it is a common practice to choose an array
size that seems "large enough". Most of the time the number of entities stored
will be smaller than the available array slots, so some memory space is wasted.
With a linked list, we allocate single nodes. No memory is wasted (except a
few bytes for each node's pointer to the next node).

<li>
Resizing an array is an expensive operation, since usually the whole array
content has to be copied from the old to the new memory location. We do not
have this problem with linked lists.

<li>
In contrast to arrays, it is a cheap operation to insert or remove entities
to / from the head or middle of a linked list. While with an array, the
following entities must all be shifted one slot to the left or right, we
simply need to (re)connect a few pointers with a linked list.
</ul>
There are some disadvantages, though:
<ul>
<li>
In contrast to an array, there is no cheap way to locate the n-th entity in a
linked list. With an array, you simply have to add the desired position
multiplied with the size of an element to the array's base address and
look at the content of the memory at this location - a very simple operation.
With a linked list, however, we need to iterate over all nodes 'n' times,
so locating the 1000th node is a rather expensive operation.

<li>
One may argue that insertion operations are more expensive with linked lists
than with arrays, since we allocate single nodes from the heap in contrast
to an array, where the whole list is one huge allocated block of memory.
Although allocation from the heap is indeed rather expensive, this is not
true when it comes to insertions to the middle of a list, these are usually
<b>way</b> more expensive with arrays. Furthermore, a list implemented using
an array such as <a href="#ulList">ulList</a> may make resizes of the array
necessary on insertions, which are again rather expensive.
</ul>
Decide yourself if a list implemented as an array such as
<a href="#ulList">ulList</a> or a linked list implementation like this one fits
your needs better.
<p>
Once you have constructed a ulLinkedList object, you can insert a node using
one of:
<pre><i>
  void ulLinkedList::appendNode ( void *data ) ;
  void ulLinkedList::prependNode ( void *data ) ;
  void ulLinkedList::insertNode ( void *data, int pos ) ;
</i></pre>
While "appendNode" adds the new node at the tail of the list, "prependNode"
will place the new node at the head of the list, and "insertNode" allows
you to specify the desired position ('0' is the first node) yourself; 'pos'
must be either '0' or a number between '0' and the number of nodes minus one.
"prependNode" is equal to calling "insertNode" with pos == 0.
<p>
Note that ulLinkedList allows you to have two nodes with the same data in
the list. Also note that just as <a href="#ulList">ulList</a>, ulLinkedList
does not make it's own copy of the memory pointed to by 'data', so make sure
that the corresponding memory location holds something useful as long as the
list exists.
<p>
To retrieve the number of nodes in the list, call:
<pre><i>
  int ulLinkedList::getNumNodes ( void ) const ;
</i></pre>
<p>
To retrieve the data of the node at a certain position in the list, call:
<pre><i>
  void * ulLinkedList::getNodeData ( int pos ) const ;
</i></pre>
Where 'pos' must be a number between '0' and the number of nodes minus one,
again.
<p>
If you need to retrieve the position of a node in the list by specifying it's
data value, call:
<pre><i>
  int ulLinkedList::getNodePosition ( void *data ) const ;
</i></pre>
If there is more than one node whose data value is 'data' in the list, this
function will return the position of the <b>first</b> one. If there is no
node with the specified data value in the list, this function will return a
negative number to indicate failure.
<p>
Checking if the return value of "getNodePosition" is non-negative is also
the recommended way to determine whether there exists at least one node with
a certain data value in a list.
<p>
To remove a node from the list, call one of:
<pre><i>
  bool ulLinkedList::removeNode ( void *data ) ;
  void * ulLinkedList::removeNode ( int pos ) ;
</i></pre>
Where the first function returns 'true' if the node was sucessfully removed or
'false' if it could not find a node whose value is 'data'. In case there is
more than one node whose data value is 'data', it will remove the <b>first</b>
one. With the second function, 'pos' has to be a number between '0' and the
number of nodes minus one. It's return value is the removed node's data
value.
<p>
To iterate over the list (starting from the head) and to have a custom
function being called for each node's data pointer, call:
<pre><i>
  typedef bool (*ulIterateFunc)( void *data, void *user_data ) ;
  void * ulLinkedList::forEach ( ulIterateFunc fn, void *user_data = NULL ) const ;
</i></pre>
The iteration process will stop if your ulIterateFunc returns 'false', in
which case "forEach" returns the data value of the node at which the iteration
stopped, or if the tail of the list has been reached, in which case "forEach"
returns NULL. The user_data pointer will be passed to your ulIterateFunc as
the second argument.
<p>
ulLinkedList allows you to maintain a sorted list as an option. To set up
a sorted list, simply be sure to insert all nodes using the sorted insertion
function as soon as there is at least one node in the list. It's prototype is:
<pre><i>
  typedef int (*ulCompareFunc)( const void *data1, const void *data2 ) ;
  int ulList::insertSorted ( void *data, ulCompareFunc comparefn ) ;
</i></pre>
Where 'comparefn' is your custom comparison function that takes two
data pointers, compares them and returns a memcmp / strcmp-like result:
<ul>
<li>
A number <b>less than zero</b> if "data1" is "smaller" than "data2", that
means if "data1" had to be inserted <b>before</b> "data2" in the list.

<li>
A number <b>equal to zero</b> if "data1" is equal to "data2", that means if
"data" had to be inserted immediately before or after "data2" in the list.

<li>
A number <b>greater than zero</b> if "data1" is "greater" than "data2",
that means if "data" had to be inserted <b>after</b> "data2" in the list.
</ul>
The return value of "insertSorted" is the position of the new node in the list
on success, or a negative value if you tried to do a sorted insertion on a
non-sorted list, that is a list which contains more than one node of which
at least one was not inserted using the sorted insertion function. In the
latter case, the new node would not have been inserted to the list.
<p>
To determine whether a list is sorted or not, call the following function:
<pre><i>
  bool ulLinkedList::isSorted ( void ) const ;
</i></pre>
Note that with a linked list, you <b>must not</b> modify the criteria of a
node's data that is used for sorting without removing the node from the list
and re-inserting it.
<p>
Finally, you can empty a list (remove all nodes) by calling:
<pre><i>
  typedef bool (*ulIterateFunc)( const void *data ) ;
  void ulList::empty ( ulIterateFunc destroyfn = NULL, void *user_data = NULL ) ;
</i></pre>
Where "destroyfn" is an optionally specified function that will be called
with each destroyed node's data pointer as the first and with user_data as
the second argument. This is for example useful if the list entries are
pointers to dynamically allocated objects that have to be freed on destruction
of the list. The return value of the specified function is ignored.

<h2><a name="errorHandling">Error handling</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ulSetErrorCallback">ulSetErrorCallback</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  typedef void (*ulErrorCallback) ( enum ulSeverity severity, char* msg ) ;
  void ulSetErrorCallback ( ulErrorCallback cb ) ;
</i></pre>
<a href="../index.html">PLIB</a> has an internal error handling system
that the subsystems use to report debug, warning or error messages.
An application can set up an error callback that PLIB will call whenever such
a message occurs in addition to printing the message on the user's terminal.
<p>
ulSeverety indicates the importance of an message and is currently defined
the following way:
<pre><i>
  enum ulSeverity
  {
    UL_DEBUG,
    UL_WARNING,
    UL_FATAL
  } ;
</i></pre>
Where
<ul>
<li>UL_DEBUG are unimportant debug messages that can usually safely be ignored
<li>UL_WARNING are important warning messages that should not be ignored
<li>UL_FATAL are fatal errors that PLIB can not recover from
</ul>

<h3><a name="ulGetErrorCallback">ulGetErrorCallback</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  typedef void (*ulErrorCallback) ( enum ulSeverity severity, char* msg ) ;
  ulErrorCallback ulGetErrorCallback ( void ) ;

<h3><a name="ulGetError">ulGetError</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  char * ulGetError ( void ) ;

<h3><a name="ulDynamicLibrary">class ulDynamicLibrary</a></h3>
<pre><i>
  ulDynamicLibrary::ulDynamicLibrary ( const char *libname ) ;
</i></pre>
This class provides a portable way to load a dynamic library and to retrieve
the memory address of a specific function afterwards. When constructing an
ulDynamicLibrary object, you have to specify the name of the dynamic library
you want to operate on <b>without</b> the platform-specific file extension
for dynamic libraries.
<p>
Afterwards, you can retrieve the memory address where a function / symbol of
the library has been loaded by calling:
<pre><i>
  void * ulDynamicLibrary::getFuncAddress ( const char *funcname ) :
</i></pre>
This function returns NULL if the specified symbol was not found.

This function provides a portable way to compare two strings while ignoring
the case of the characters. We need it since half of the machines on the
planet provide strcasecmp and the other half stricmp for this purpose.
<p>
In contrast to the libc string comparison routines, this routine returns '1'
