<H1>Introduction</H1>
Whilst applications can use any suitable scripting
language (Python, PERL, Lua, etc) in conjunction with PLIB, there are
attractions to using PLIB's own scripting language: PSL.
<p>
In particular, in using PSL, you do not add any dependancies on
your application.  If the end user has the correct version of PLIB
installed - then the scripting language is already there - for sure.
<p>
PSL is a very light-weight C-like language with some features borrowed
from C++.  It's also 'stackless' and very friendly to games applications.
<p>
There are two PSL documents:
<ul>
<li><a href="appl_guide.html">The PSL-enabled Applications Guide.</a>
-- If you are planning on including a PSL interpreter into your program,
(making it 'PSL-enabled') then you should read the Applications Guide.
<li><a href="prog_guide.html">The PSL Programmers Guide.</a>
-- If you are writing scripts for a PSL-enabled application, then you'll
only need to read the Programmer's Guide.
<li><a href="impl_guide.html">The PSL Implementation Guide.</a>
-- Explains some of PSL's internals, especially, the byte-code
virtual machine.
</ul>
<p>
Each application can extend PSL by providing additional built-in
functions - so if you are a PSL programer then you'll probably need to 
read the documentation for whatever PSL-enabled application
you are writing for.  If you are writing a PSL-enabled application, then
you'd better sit down and WRITE that document!
