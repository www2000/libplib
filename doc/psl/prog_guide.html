<H1>Introduction</H1>

This document explains how to write PSL programs.

<p>

How you actually run those programs depends on which PSL-enabled
application you are running.  There is a stand-alone PSL interpreter
in plib/examples/src/psl/psl_demo - but it doesn't include any
application-specific language extensions - so a PSL program
that's written for a specific application may not run
on <code>psl_demo</code>.

<p>

However, psl_demo is great for learning to write PSL scripts.

<H1>The PSL Language</H1>

PSL is designed to be as close to the C Programming
Language - although we
cut a few corners - we extended the language in a few places - and
we consciously omitted other features that are dangerous in a
scripting language.

<p>

The following C features are implemented much as you'd expect:
<ul>
  <li> Types 'void', 'int' and 'float' (and arrays of those things).
  <li> Function definitions.
  <li> Global variable definitions.
  <li> Statement types:
  <ul>
    <li> Local variable definitions.
    <li> Static variable definitions.
    <li> "return"
    <li> "break"
    <li> "continue"
    <li> "for"
    <li> "do/while"
    <li> "switch/case/default"
    <li> "while"
    <li> "if"
    <li> "if/else"
    <li> "{}" compound statements.
    <li> Assignment statements.
    <li> Procedure calls.
  </ul>
  <li> Most Arithmetic operators.
  <li> Comments '/*' '*/'.
  <li> C preprocessor directives:
  <ul>
    <li> "#include"
    <li> "#define" without parameters.
    <li> "#undef"
    <li> "#ifdef/#endif"
    <li> "#ifdef/#else/#endif"
    <li> "#ifndef/#endif"
    <li> "#ifndef/#else/#endif"
  </ul>
  <li> Special characters in strings:
  <ul>
    <li> "\n"
    <li> "\r"
    <li> "\a"
    <li> "\b"
    <li> "\f"
    <li> "\t"
    <li> "\\"
    <li> "\""
  </ul>
  <li> Recursion, etc.
</ul>

Some new features have been added that are not part of C:
<ul>
  <li> "pause" -- Pause the program until next frame.
  <li> "string" data type (and arrays of strings).
  <li> Casts are unnecessary between compatible types.
  <li> C++ style '//' comments.
  <li> C++ style local variable declarations.
</ul>
Some features of C are NOT IMPLEMENTED in PSL:
<ul>
  <li> Pointers.
  <li> Casts.
  <li> Dynamic Memory Allocation.
  <li> ',' and '?:' operators in expressions.
  <li> "static", "auto" and "register" storage class reserved words.
  <li> "char", "short", "unsigned", "signed", "long", "double".
  <li> "typedef"
  <li> "enum", "union", bitfields.
  <li> "goto".
  <li> "#if"
  <li> "#pragma"
  <li> "#define" with parameters.
  <li> 'f' and 'l' suffixes for float and long numbers.
  <li> All preprocessor directives must have the '#' as the
       very first character on the line - they cannot be
       preceded with whitespace.
</ul>

The following features are "NOT IMPLEMENTED YET" - but will
hopefully arrive soon:
<ul>
  <li> Multiple variable definitions like 'int i, j, k ;'
  <li> Structs.
  <li> '\' to escape the end-of-line character in strings and macro's.
  <li> Parameter passing by name.
  <li> Many of C's standard library functions are needed.
</ul>

<H1> Compatibility Notes: </H1>
<H3> C++ style local variables. </H3>
With PSL's C++ style locals, you can say things like this:
<pre>

    for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ )  /* Do something */ ;

</pre>
In standard C++, the scope of the variable 'i' is from it's
declaration to the end of the 'for' loop.  However, Microsoft's
Visual C++ uses an obsolete version of the C++ standard that
allows the scope of 'i' to continue to the end of the block
that contains the for loop. So:
<p>
WINDOWS USERS BEWARE: PSL IMPLEMENTS THIS CORRECTLY - *NOT* LIKE
MSVC.

<H1>Hard Limits</H1>
Currently there are hard limits in many places - the number of
variables, the size of the program, the depth of nesting, etc.
These limits will gradually be removed as PSL is developed.

<H1>Debugging PSL Programs</H1>

Specific PSL-enabled applications may have their own
special features to assist with debugging - but all
PSL-enabled applications support several 'shell variables'
that enable certain debugging features.
<p>
When using a command line shell, you can set these
variables using one of the following commands before
you run your application:
<pre>
    setenv VARIABLE value     -- csh or tcsh
    export VARIABLE=value     -- bash or sh
    set VARIABLE=value        -- DOS shell
</pre>
<H3> Byte-Code Dump </H3>
It's possible to view the byte code that PSL generated
by setting the shell variable 'PSL_DUMP' to either:
<ul>
<li> <b>never</b> (the default) -- Never produce a dump unless
          the application demands it.
<li> <b>on_error</b> -- Produce a dump whenever the PSL program
          fails to compile for whatever reason.
<li> <b>always</b> -- Always produce a dump after the PSL program
          finishes compiling.
</ul>
<H3> Byte-Code Execution Trace </H3>
It's possible to view the byte code as it's executed
by setting the shell variable 'PSL_TRACE' to either:
<ul>
<li> <b>never</b> (the default) -- Never produce a trace unless
          the application demands it.
<li> <b>always</b> -- Always produce a trace.
</ul>
When the execution trace is enabled, extra instructions will be
inserted into the byte code to enable the PSL interpreter to
produce debug indicating which lines of the source code are
being traced.
<H3> Byte-Code Stack Display </H3>
If you have PSL_TRACE turned on (either via the config variable or
by the application program), then the shell variable 'PSL_STACK'
can be set to display the contents of the top eight stack locations
as the program is traced.  If PSL_TRACE is disabled then PSL_STACK
has no effect.
<ul>
<li> <b>never</b> (the default) -- Never produce stack dumps
          within a trace.
<li> <b>always</b> -- Always produce a stack dump within trace.
</ul>
