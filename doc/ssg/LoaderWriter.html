<H2>How to write plib-loaders and writers</H2>

<H2>1.1 Introduction</H2>

This page is intended for those who wish to write loaders and writers
for plib. If you just use plib (using the included loaders and writers), you don't 
really need to read this.

It is quite easy to adapt 3D-file-loaders and writers to be used by ssg. Plib
already has many loaders and writers that may be used as examples.<p>

A brief note on cross platform compilation: Plib comes with 
both Makefiles (for Unix and for the CygWin-system under Windows)
and workspace/project-files for Micro$oft Visual C++. If you 
have both, please update, test and commit both.
Otherwise, when committing, please tell the people that something is
missing (for example: you didn't update the workspace files) and that some 
kind soul should do so.
<p>

Both loaders and writers convert between ssg's internal geometry 
representation and that of the file format. One key difference is that when 
loading, you should support all possibile 
geometry-representations of the file format. This is to ensure that
plib can handle all the possible variations of a file format that may be generated
by the tools that export to it. On the other hand, when writing a format, you can 
pretty safely only write to one geometry format (unless you need features peculiar 
to more than one geometry representation), because you have the final say on how the 
data is to be written. 
<p>

Regarding plib's geometry-representations: there are only two on the highest
level: <code>ssgVtxTable</code> and <code>ssgVtxArray</code>. Actually, there is also 
ssgVTable, but that is deprecated.

<code>ssgVtxArray</code> is newer, is derived
from ssgVtxTable and uses a index-list. Apart from that they are quite
similar, and both have an interface <code>getNumTriangles () ; </code> and
<code>getTriangle ( i, ...); </code>
For this reasons, it is easier to write a writer than a loader.


For both ssgVtxTable and ssgVtxArray you need to choose a
GL-type. Currently ssgLoaderWriterMesh (more on this in the
next section) uses <code>GL_TRIANGLES</code>.


<H2>1.2 class ssgLoaderWriterMesh - an overview</H2>

The two main parts of writing a loader are writing the actual parser (coding 
the syntax of the format) and transferring the contents
to ssg. The second task is fairly trivial if your contents
obey the restrictions of ssg (which follow from OpenGL).
<BR><BR>
These are:
<BR><BR>

1. Each ssg-node can (currently) have only one texture.
<BR>
2. Only one polygon or strip or fan per node. So you can't have a 3-, a 4- and a 5-sided
poly inside one node (without subdividing the polys into triangles)
<BR>
3. Currently, you may have only one texture coordinate per vertex.
<BR>
4. You may have only one normal per vertex.
<BR><BR>
To modularize the two steps parsing the format and transfering it to ssg
and to reduce redundant work, there is an intermediatory structure, the class
ssgLoaderWriterMesh. For example, this has a member function
<pre>
void ssgLoaderWriterMesh::addFaceFromIntegerArray( int numVertices, int *vertices );
</pre>
With several calls, you can add several n-sided polys to one mesh ("one node").
When you are done constructing the mesh from the file, you call
<pre>
void ssgLoaderWriterMesh::addToSSG(
		class ssgSimpleState *currentState,
		class ssgLoaderOptions* current_options,
		class ssgBranch *curr_branch_)
</pre>
and the class adds the information into the scene graph. It handles
ssgs' restrictions. For example, if the polygons of the mesh use 
5 textures then at least 5 nodes will be added to the scene graph.<p>

Unfortunately, this class isn't completely finished. As of this
writing, Wolfram Kuss (w_kuss@rz-online.de) has implemented those
parts that were needed for the loaders he has finished thus far. Hopefully 
people will contribute more features as time goes on.<p>

If you are writing a new loader for a file format that doesn't hold to
all restrictions of ssg (and virtually none do), you are urged to use this class. 
Your loader will be more consistent and easier to maintain and read.<p>

Further, there are many optimizations that can be done (For example: "If the state is 
different, but not the texture, do we need several nodes?" or "When we have multitexturing, 
can we use that?" or "Is there an optimal strip length?" or "How do I subdivide polys into 
triangles so that the stripifier will work well?"-- the list goes on
forever). Once we have good answers to these questions (and the will
to implement them), it will be easier to do them once in the ssgLoaderWriterMesh than in all the 
loaders seperately. It is noteable that most loaders written before
ssgLoaderWriterMesh have had some sort of intermediatory mesh
structure.<p>

In the future, ssgLoaderWriterMesh should also be used for writers, doing the opposite 
job: It takes the information from ssg with the restrictions and then looks whether
it can optimize (for example merging nodes) by relaxing the restrictions.

<H2>1.3 The Class ssgLoaderWriterMesh - A Deeper Look</H2>
At the start of your loader, you create a new <code>ssgLoaderWriterMesh</code>
or do a <code>reInit()</code>. To insert the data into the <code>ssgLoaderWriterMesh</code>,
you have to add vertices, faces, materials, materialindexes (saying what face uses what material)
and, if applicable texture coordinates. For all of these, you <B>can</B> say in advance how many you have.
If you know that you have 3712 vertices, call <code>createVertices(3712)</code> and everything is allocated
at once and <code>addVertex</code> will be very fast. If you don't know in advance how many you have, you 
still have to call <code>createVertices()</code>, as this also allocates the vertices. In this case, a 
certain amount of vertices will be reserved and the list will dynamically grow as more are added.<p>

Vertices are simply sgVec3s. Faces are simply lists/arrays of vertex indexes.
For adding faces, use <code>addFace</code> if you already have a <code>ssgIndexArray</code> or use
<code>addFaceFromIntegerArray</code> if you have the vertex indexes in a C(++) array.
You need to add at least one material (<code>ssgSimpleState</code>). For each face, you tell
ssg which material to use via <code>addMaterialIndex</code>. Here is code from ssgLoadOFF, which tells
ssg to use the <code>ssgSimpleState</code> ss for all faces:

<BR>
<pre>

	theMesh.createMaterials( 1 );
	theMesh.addMaterial( &amp;ss );
	theMesh.createMaterialIndices( _ssgNoFacesToRead ) ;
	for(i=0;i<_ssgNoFacesToRead ;i++)
	   theMesh.addMaterialIndex ( 0 ) ;
</pre>
<BR>
If the file format has texture coordinates, you have to find out whether it has them 
per vertex or per vertex and face. If you look at a "straight forward" cube,
having texture coordinates per vertex means you can have 8, but if you have
texture coordinates per vertex and face, you can have 24 (each vertex is part of 3 faces).
The two functions corresponding to these cases are:
<pre>
       void createPerFaceAndVertexTextureCoordinates2( int numReservedTextureCoordinate2Lists = 3 );
       void addPerFaceAndVertexTextureCoordinate2( ssgTexCoordArray **textureCoordinateArray ); 
</pre>
or
<pre>
        void createPerVertexTextureCoordinates2( int numReservedTextureCoordinates2 = 3 ); 
        void addPerVertexTextureCoordinate2( sgVec2 textureCoordinate ); 
</pre>


<H2>2. Loaders</H2>


<H2>2.1 class ssgLoaderOptions</H2>

ssgLoaderOptions is a class that is defined in ssg.h.
It is used to tell the loader some options.
It is NOT used for user-setable options, although
this may be nice to have at some point. For example, 
one COULD create a member-variable in it
telling the unit that one wants. The loader would then 
be responsible to scale the object in such a way that
the sizes are in that unit (for example: meter, millimeter, etc).

Regarding the reason for the callbacks in ssgLoaderOptions, Steve
wrote:
<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<i>"Whenever a branch node is created.  The deal is that most file formats
are
missing important features at the Branch level - but many support
comment
fields - or long ASCII name strings or something. The idea was to allow the artists to attach an ARBITARY comment string
in their modeller - and to have the loader trap these strings and pass
them on to the application.</i><p>

<i>Hence, if the hook function is defined then when a branch node needs
to
be created, we call the application's callback with the ASCII string
that was embedded in the file and let the application construct the
ssgBranch
node.  Hence, you could put the string "~LOD: RANGE=100 meters"
into the comment field in (say) the AC3D modeller.  (AC3D calls this a
"Data"
field)...the application could then say to itself: "Any comment that
starts
with a tilde ('~') is a command to the loader" and parse such
'comments'
as commands.  In this case, it would construct an ssgRangeSelector and
set
the transition range to 100m and return the application back to the
loader.</i><p>

<i>Check the <a href="http://tuxkart.sf.net">Tux Kart</a> sources to see this in action."</i>
</blockquote>

So much for the quote from Steve.
<p>

As of this writing, the ssgLoaderOptions code has been copied from 
another loader into ssgLoaderWriterMesh.


<H2>2.2 ASCII file formats</H2>
A lexical analyzer for ascii-files is available in ssgParser.cxx and 
ssgParser.h. It converts the file into a stream of tokens and 
handles comments. In a way, it has two APIs.
One hides the line structure from the loader. The loader just has 
to say "getNextToken".
The other API operates in terms of exact line structure.
You do a getLine which reads all the tokens of that line into a 
buffer and then you do a parseToken to get each token.<p>

The formats which currently use the parser are .X (which uses the
line-independant API), .ase, .scenery and .off (which use the
line-by-line-API).<p>
Some functions are used by both APIs. For example:<p>

<pre>
	void openFile( const char* fname, const _ssgParserSpec* spec = 0 );
</pre><p>

In ssgParserSpec, you give the parser the specification of the format.
You say which characters start a comment, which characters are skipable,
which characters are used for braces (which are used to determine the
parser's level-- useful for parser's which work recursively).
Most important are the delimiters. These determine where one token ends and the 
next one begins. For example, the first token of the line

<pre>
1234,567
</pre>

is <code>1234</code> if <code>","</code> is a delimiter and
<code>1234,567</code> otherwise.
The parser differentiates between skipable delimiters that
are "swallowed" by the parser and non-skipable ones that are
passed to the loader. So, regarding the example-line there 
are three possibilities:
<BR>
<code>","</code> is not a delimiter => The line contains one token, namely
<code>"1234,567"</code>
<BR>
<code>","</code> is a skipable delimiter => The line contains two tokens, namely
<code>"1234"</code> and <code>"567"</code>
<BR>
<code>","</code> is a non-skipable delimiter => The line contains three tokens, 
namely <code>"1234"</code>, <code>","</code> and <code>"567"</code>
<BR>


<H2>3. Writers</H2>
For an example how to write out geometry and material, look at
ssgSaveASE.

For an easy example (geometry only), look at <code>ssgSaveDXF</code> or <code>ssgSaveTRI</code>.
The function

<pre>
int ssgSaveXYZ ( const char *filename, ssgEntity *ent )
</pre>

normally calls a function 

<pre>
static void save_entities ( ssgEntity *e )
</pre>

which just recursively walks the scene graph.
You should be able to use this function and just
write a

<pre>
static void save_vtx_table ( ssgVtxTable *vt )
</pre>

which writes a <code>ssgVtxTable</code>.<p>
