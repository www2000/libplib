<H2><code>class ssgBase</code> - The Universal Abstract Base Class.</H2>
All significant SSG classes are derived from ssgBase - which offers a type testing
mechanism and a means to print out the tree hierarchy in human-readable form,
or to save/load it to/from disk.
<pre>

class ssgBase 
{
  void  ref () ;
  void  deRef () ;
  int     getRef () ;

  int   isA ( int ty ) ;
  int   isAKindOf  ( int ty ) ;

  int   getType (void) ;
  virtual char *getTypeName(void) ;

  ssgBase *getUserData () ;
  void  setUserData ( ssgBase *user_data ) ;

  void  setName ( char *nm ) ;
  char *getName () ;
  const char *getPrintableName () ;

  virtual void print ( FILE *fd = stderr, char *indent = "", int how_much = 2 ) ;
  virtual int load ( FILE *fd ) ;
  virtual int save  ( FILE *fd = stderr ) ;

  ssgBase *clone ( int clone_flags ) ;
}  ;

</pre>

<H3>Reference Counting.</H3>
All SSG classes are reference counted - that means that whenever you
connect a node into the scene graph with <code>ssgBranch::addKid()</code>, we
increment its reference count and each time we remove a node from
the graph with <code>ssgBranch::removeKid()</code>, we decrement the count -
and if it's zero, we'll delete the node to recover memory.
<p>
Sometimes, you need a node to stay in memory even though it may be
be disconnected from the scene graph. You can achieve that by
calling <code>ssgBase::ref()</code> to increment the reference count.
If you later find you don't need that node anymore then you may
<code>ssgBase::deRef()</code> it. If you <code>ssgBase::deRef()</code>
a node to zero, SSG won't automatically delete it - you still need to use
<code>delete</code> to do that.  Since such deletions are recursive,
you may delete an entire sub-branch with a single call.
<p>
Instead of using <code>ssgBase::deRef()</code> directly, you should use
<code>ssgDeRefDelete()</code> which automatically deletes the node if
the reference count drops to zero.
<p>
You can read the current ref count for a node
using <code>ssgBase::getRef()</code>.
<H3>Names.</H3>
It's often useful to attach an ASCII name to a node in the
scene graph - this is often derived from a name field in
whatever modelling tool was used to create the object.
<code>ssgBase::setName(s)</code> sets the name,
<code>ssgBase::getName()</code> returns it.

<H3>User Data</H3>
Although one can derive a new C++ class from an SSG class and thereby customise
it's behavior, it's often more convenient to simply attach application-specific
data structures to a basic entity. Two functions are provided:
<code>ssgBase::getUserData()</code> and <code>ssgBase::setUserData(data)</code>.
<p>
Notice that user data is of class ssgBase - which means that user data
can be named, ref-counted - and can in turn have user data of it's own.
This allows user data to be formed into linked lists when multiple
user data items need to be attached to a single node.

<H3>Destructor Functions</H3>
When an SSG entity is NOT connected into the scene graph in any
way, then the correct way to get rid of it and free up memory
is to call it's destructor function.  However, when the entity
is included into the scene graph, you should disconnect it
from the tree and let the reference count mechanism take care
of the cleanup.
<H3>Type Names</H3>
SSG frequently needs to know what kind of an object an ssgBase is. 
Since C++ programs may create new classes that inherit from SSG
classes, we provide several functions to make run time type determination
possible.  There is an external function for each type that
returns the type token for that type:
<pre>

  int ssgTypeBase       () ;
  int ssgTypeEntity     () ;
  int ssgTypeLeaf       () ;
  int ssgTypeVTable     () ;
  int ssgTypeVtxTable   () ;
  int ssgTypeDisplayList() ;
  int ssgTypeBranch     () ;
  int ssgTypeBaseTransform ();
  int ssgTypeTransform  () ;
  int ssgTypeTexTrans   () ;
  int ssgTypeSelector   () ;
  int ssgTypeTimedSelector () ;
  int ssgTypeRangeSelector () ;
  int ssgTypeRoot       () ;
  int ssgTypeCutout     () ;

</pre>
Now, you can use the <code>ssgBase::isA(type)</code> or <code>ssgBase::isAKindOf</code>
to test the type of the node. For example, if you want to test
whether a node is a Leaf node or a Branch node, you can do this:
<pre>

  if ( mynode -> isAKindOf ( ssgTypeLeaf() ) )
    printf ( "Leaf node\n" ) ;
  else
  if ( mynode -> isAKindOf ( ssgTypeBranch() ) )
    printf ( "Branch node\n" ) ;
  else
    printf ( "Something else\n" ) ;

</pre>
Notice that if you ran that code on (say) an ssgSelector, then it'll
print "Branch node" since the Selector class is derived from the Branch
class. If you wanted to tell if a node was *exactly* a Branch node -
and not from a derived class, then you could use:
<pre>

  if ( mynode -> isA ( ssgTypeBranch() ) )
    printf ( "Branch node\n" ) ;

</pre>
Finally, you can actually read the type of a node - either as a
token (using <code>ssgBase::getType()</code>) or as an ASCII string
(using <code>ssgBase::getTypeName()</code>). The latter is very useful
for debug routines:
<pre>

  printf ( "ERROR - something wrong with my '%s' node.\n",
                    mynode -> getTypeName () ) ;

</pre>

<H3>Printing</H3>
It's sometimes useful during debug to print a section of the
scene graph so you can examine it. <code>ssgBase::print(fd, indent, how_much)</code>
does that for you - it prints out the node itself - and anything
connected beneath it in the scene graph. <code>fd</code> is the
file descriptor to print to (defaults to stderr) and
<code>indent</code> is a string that will prefix all output lines
- and is used internally within SSG to make printout of tree
structures more legible by indenting them.  
<p>
The values for the parameter <code>how_much</code> may be 0,1,2,3 or 4 
and determine how much is printed, with 0 meaning little 
and 4 meaning much.
<BR>
For how_much = 0, basic information of the branches is printed
<BR>
For 1, additionally there is: basic leaf info, state pointers
<BR>
For 2, additionally there is: states, user data, number of parents,
bSphere
<BR>
For 3, additionally there is: Reference count
<BR>
For 4, additionally there is: contents of vertex-, normal-, colour-,
texCoord- and index-arrays
<BR>
Experience tells that for <code>how_much = 0</code> you get very little
out put, with 1, 2 and 3 a manageable amount and with 4 a huge amount, 
up to 100 MB for a medium sized model.


<p>
It would be unwise
to attempt to parse the output of <code>ssgBase::print</code> into another
program since it is only intended for human consumption and the
format may change dramatically between revisions of SSG.

<H3>Cloning:</H3>
All classes derived from ssgBase have a member function
<code>ssgBase *clone(int clone_flags)</code> which new's a
new object of that class as a copy of the calling object.
<p>
The 'clone_flags' is a set of tokens that you 'OR' together to
specify how 'deep' you want the cloning to go.  By default
(with clone_flags==0), only the object itself is cloned and
the clone will simply point to the same child structures as
the original object. However, if you OR in 'SSG_CLONE_RECURSIVE',
then all ssgEntities beneath this one will also be cloned.
ORing in SSG_CLONE_GEOMETRY will cause all the per-vertex data
at the leaf nodes to also be cloned.  SSG_CLONE_STATE causes
ssgState objects to be cloned also, SSG_CLONE_STATE_RECURSIVE
also causes states pointed to by other states to be copied,
SSG_CLONE_USERDATA causes user data attached to
the original node to be referenced (NOT copied) by the clone -
otherwise, user data for the clone is set to NULL.  Finally,
SSG_CLONE_TEXTURE causes texture maps to be replicated also.
<p>
Most copy operations will typically use either zero, SSG_CLONE_RECURSIVE
or (SSG_CLONE_RECURSIVE | SSG_CLONE_GEOMETRY)
